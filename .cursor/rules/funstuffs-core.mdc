# funStuffs Core Rules

- **Project shape**
  - This repo is a **playground of small, focused subprojects** (see `README.md` and `SUBPROJECTS.md`).
  - Treat each subfolder (`todo/`, `web/`, `tools/`, `experiments/`, etc.) as a mostly independent mini-project with its own README and entry points.
  - Prefer adding new work as a new subproject or inside an existing one, not by growing `main.py` arbitrarily.

- **Entry points**
  - Root entry: `main.py` (`python main.py`) is a tiny demo and should stay simple.
  - `todo/` is a **package with a CLI entry** (`python -m todo`); keep CLI glue thin and most logic in importable functions.

- **Python style & structure**
  - Prefer **small, pure functions** and thin I/O or CLI wrappers.
  - Keep modules short and focused; if a file grows large, split by responsibility.
  - Avoid clever, hard-to-read constructs; explicit is better than implicit.

- **Testing & safety**
  - Use `pytest` from the repo root; add or update tests in `tests/` or the relevant subproject when changing behavior.
  - After non-trivial edits, **run tests before considering the work “done”**.
  - When touching the todo CLI, cover core flows: add, list, done, remove, clear-completed, search, and storage edge cases.

- **AI-assisted workflow**
  - Be **biased toward small, incremental changes** with clear intent.
  - Do not introduce heavy dependencies without an explicit reason; prefer standard library first.
  - Keep generated code well-documented via READMEs and, where needed, concise comments explaining non-obvious decisions (not narrating obvious code).

- **Documentation**
  - When adding or changing behavior in a subproject, update its local `README.md` and, if relevant, `SUBPROJECTS.md`.
  - Keep docs short, example-driven (especially CLI usage), and up to date with actual behavior.
