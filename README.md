A small Codex project scaffold created by the assistant.

Overview
- Minimal Python project with a simple CLI entrypoint (main.py).
- Includes README, .gitignore, requirements.txt, and a run.sh helper.

How to run
1. Create and activate a venv in the project folder:
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
2. Install requirements (if any):
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   python main.py

Next steps
- If you want, I can ask Codex (npx @openai/codex) to generate features, tests, or additional modules for this project. Just tell me what you'd like the project to do.
